  <p class="mt-10 text-xl">
    I started programming about 15 years ago. <br />
    Back in the days i learned Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET.
    <br />
    After some time i realized that Visual Basic only works on Windows machines.
    And since i wanted my apps to work on all distributions i came across web development.
    I then started learning HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL all by myself. After school
    i started studying Information Technology and worked a little bit as a kind of
    Freelancer. In 2014 i started my professional career.
